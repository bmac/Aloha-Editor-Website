				<h1>Aloha Editor Contribution</h1>
				<p>Thank you for your interest to contribute to the Aloha Editor project.</p>
				<p>In order to develop Aloha Editor as open source project in a proper legal way all contributors signed and new contributors need to sign a contribution agreement similar to the one from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt">Apache Software Foundation</a>, if their contributions should be included into the core. Only pull requests of contributors listed on the <a href="/about.php">About</a> page may be merged.</p>
				<p>Please read the <a href="Aloha_Editor_contribution_agreement _v2.pdf">Aloha Editor contribution agreement</a> and send a proper filled and signed copy to info [at] aloha-editor [dot] org if you want to contribute.</p> 
				<p>You should update your <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> in order to get listed nicer on the contributors list :) . You can also add an URL so you will get a backlink to a website you like. Thank you for your help!</p>
