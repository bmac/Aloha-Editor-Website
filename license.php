				<h1>Aloha Editor License</h1>
                <p>Aloha Editor is meant to be of benefit to both free open source as well as commercial software developers. It should be able to sustain continous development by itself and thus help all stakeholders profiting from the developments to come. Therefore we adopted a dual licensing approach for Aloha Editor.</p>

                    Generally Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program ensuring

                    open source projects that are MIT, BSD or similar licensed.
                    For example: <a href="http://locomotivecms.com/">Locomotive CMS</a> is MIT,
                    Aloha Editor is GPLv2, with the FOSS exception, Locomotive CMS can distribute Aloha Editor and remain MIT, but Aloha Editor will remain GPLv2.
