					<h3>Frequently asked questions and answers</h3>
					
					<h4 id=1>1. I have server side software such as a CMS (or other software) GPLv3 licensed. Can I CHANGE OR EXTEND AND DISTRIBUTE Aloha Editor with it?</h4>
					<p>
					Yes, you can and we encourage you to do so. AGPLv3 and GPLv3 are compatible. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#v3Notwithstanding">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#v3Notwithstanding</a>. If you modify the Aloha Editor source code or distribute derived work you need to publish the changes or the source code of the derived work AGPLv3 compatible.
					</p>

					<h4 id=2>2. I have server side software such as a CMS (or other software) BSD (revised), MIT, ASL or similar licensed. Can I CHANGE OR EXTEND AND DISTRIBUTE Aloha Editor with it?</h4>
					<p>
					Yes, you can and we encourage you to do so. You are not allowed to change the license of Aloha Editor components. If you modify the source code or distribute derived work you need to publish the changes or the source code of the derived work AGPLv3 compatible. You need a FOSS license exception to distribute Aloha Editor with BSD, MIT or similar licensed software. Eg. Locomotive CMS is MIT, Aloha Editor is AGPLv3, with the FOSS exception, Locomotive CMS can distribute Aloha Editor and remain MIT, but Aloha Editor will remain AGPLv3. <a href="http://aloha-editor.org/contact.php">Contact us to get a FOSS license exception!</a>
					</p>

					<h4 id=3>3. Do I need to publish modifications to a GPLv3 server side component?</h4>
					<p>
					No, you do not need to publish those changes. The GPL does not require you to release your modified version, or any part of it. You are free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever releasing them. This applies to organizations (including companies), too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally without ever releasing it outside the organization. But if you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL. Publishing it to the Aloha Editor project is welcomed. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic</a>.
					</p>

					<h4 id=4>4. Do I need to publish extensions to a GPLv3 server side component?</h4>
					<p>
					No, you do not need to publish extensions as not needed by the GPLv3 from your server side software as long as you do not modify the software. If you modify it you may need to publish the changes depending on the GPLv3. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic</a>
					</p>

					<h4 id=5>5. I want to use a GPLv3 licensed software, which is distributed as one package with Aloha Editor and provide a SAAS Service. Can I do that?</h4>
					<p>
					Yes, you can and we encourage you to do so. If you want to change the source code you need to publish changes to your users. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AGPLv3CorrespondingSource">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AGPLv3CorrespondingSource</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean</a>. Publishing it to the Aloha Editor project is welcomed. If you don't want to publish any change think about a commercial license and support with it the continuous development of Aloha Editor.
					</p>

					<h4 id=6>6. I want to distribute Aloha Editor for a fee. Can I do that?</h4>
					<p>
					Yes, you can and we encourage you to do so. This is part of free software. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</a>.
					</p>
<!--
					<h4 id=7>7. I want to sell Aloha Editor along with my commercial and non open-source CMS (project) and I don't want apply to the AGPLv3. Or I just don't worry about that. Can I do that?</h4>
					<p>
