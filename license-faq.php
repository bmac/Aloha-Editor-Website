                            <h3>Frequently asked questions and answers</h3>

                            <h4 id="1">1. Aloha Editor is licensed "GPLv2 or later"? What does that mean?</h4>
                            <p>
                            It means that users will always be permitted to use it, and even change it, according to the terms of GPLv2 - even after later versions of the GPL (like GPLv3) are available. (for more detail see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#VersionTwoOrLater" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">GNU FAQ</a>)
                            </p>

                            <h4 id="2">2. I have server side software such as a CMS (or other software) GPLv3 licensed. Can I CHANGE OR EXTEND AND DISTRIBUTE Aloha Editor with it?</h4>
                            <p>
                            Yes, you can and we encourage you to do so. Aloha Editor is licensed under GPLv2 and later. That means later versions of the GPL (like GPLv3) are also valid.
                            </p>

                            <h4 id="3">3. I have server side software such as a CMS (or other software) BSD (revised), MIT, ASL or similar licensed. Can I CHANGE OR EXTEND AND DISTRIBUTE Aloha Editor with it?</h4>
                            <p>
                            Yes, you are allowed to to distribute Aloha Editor with BSD, MIT or similar licensed software after getting a FOSS license exception from us. You are not allowed to change the license of Aloha Editor itself. If you distribute derived work you need to publish the changes or the source code of the derived work GPLv2 or later compatible.  Eg. Locomotive CMS is MIT, Aloha Editor is GPLv2 or later. With the FOSS exception, Locomotive CMS can distribute Aloha Editor and remain MIT, but Aloha Editor reamains GPLv2 or later. <a href="http://aloha-editor.org/contact.php" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">Contact us to get a FOSS license exception!</a>
                            </p>

                            <h4 id="4">4. Do I need to publish modifications to a GPL server side component in every case?</h4>
                            <p>
                            No, the GPL does not require you to release your modified version, or any part of it in every case. You are free to make modifications and use them privately, without ever releasing them. This applies to organizations (including companies), too; an organization can make a modified version and use it internally without ever releasing it outside the organization. But if you release the modified version to the <strong>public</strong> in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL. Publishing it to the Aloha Editor project is welcomed. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic</a>.
                            </p>

                            <h4 id="5">5. Do I need to publish extensions to a GPL server side component?</h4>
                            <p>
                            No, you do not need to publish extensions as not needed by the GPL from your server side software as long as you do not modify the software. If you modify it you may need to publish the changes depending on the GPL. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic</a>
                            </p>


                            <h4 id="6">6. I want to distribute Aloha Editor for a fee. Can I do that?</h4>
                            <p>
                            Yes, you can and we encourage you to do so. This is part of free software. See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html" data-bitly-type="bitly_hover_card">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html</a>.
